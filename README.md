# Belly_Button_Plotly
## Overview

This project's goal was to help Roza build a webpage to display data on belly button bacterial growth as part of research to track certain species of bacteria for use in a meat-substitute product. Through the module, we build a drop-down menu to select a research participant's ID number and a table to display their demographic data. Then, for this challenge, I built a bar chart to display the top 10 most prominent bacteria found in the subject's belly button, a bubble chart to show the relative prevalance of each type of bacteria found, and a gauge to display the frequency of belly button washing per week for that subject. I then added some customization to the page in the form of a belly button image for the jumbotron, and changing the background and font colors to provide some contrast between each of the table and chart elements.
